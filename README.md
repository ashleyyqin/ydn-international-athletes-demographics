# Yale Athletic Teams Demographics - through the decade

This repository contains resources for a Yale Daily News analysis of the international population of Yale's athletic teams. The associated story, titled *ANALYSIS: A shifting demographic for storied Yale crew - International athletes elevate the Elis*, can be found [here](http://features.yaledailynews.com/blog/2020/04/24/analysis-a-shifting-demographic-for-storied-yale-crew-international-athletes-elevate-the-elis/).

Ashley Qin, a data analyst and staff reporter with the News, analyzed the data, extracted key data insights, and prepared the story for publication. William McCormack and Drew Beckman, staff reporters with the Sports desk, sourced students and coaches, and wrote a majority of the story.

## Data and Processing
Yale athletic team data was extracted from the [Yale Bulldogs athletics website](https://yalebulldogs.com/index.aspx). Yale undergraduates' hometowns were extracted from the student directory (anonymized data available in `geocoded.xls`).

## Visualization
Tableau was used to create visualizations for the data.
